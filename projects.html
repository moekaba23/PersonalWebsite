      <h3>The Problem</h3>
      <p>Many investors today have multiple investment accounts with different financial institutions, which can be difficult to manage and keep track of. They have to log in to different platforms, remember multiple login credentials, and navigate
        through different interfaces to check their portfolio performance and balances. Although there are valid reasons to why that is, such as compliance issues, it is still a major frustration for the average investor.</p>
      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p>We decided to come up with a platform would allow investors to link all of their accounts with different financial institutions, and view them in a single, unified interface. The platform would simplify the process of managing multiple
        investment accounts, and give users a holistic view of their portfolio.</p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <p>A user-centered approach based on research and feedback from target users. It would include an intuitive navigation system and a clear, easy-to-use interface that would enable users to quickly and easily access the information they need.

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>I conducted user interviews with a diverse group of 8 people within the ages of 23 â€“ 55 who have retirements account, stocks and/or cryptocurrencies. The interviews aimed to gain insights into the current investment management process,
          identify pain points and areas for improvement, and understand the specific needs of the users. It also helped us to get an idea of what our users were looking
          for.</p>
        <h3>Competition Analysis</h3>
        <p>To understand the competitive landscape and to identify best practices for the unified investment management platform, a competition analysis was done. The analysis revealed that several existing platforms in the market offered a limited
          ability to link accounts from different financial institutions, and were not able to offer a unified view of the user's portfolio.</p>
        <span class="space"></span>
        <p>In contrast, our platform aims to create a unified investment management platform that addresses the frustration of managing multiple accounts, by providing an integrated, user-friendly platform that empowers users to make
          informed investment decisions, while keeping track of their portfolio and reducing time and effort spent on the account management process.</p>
